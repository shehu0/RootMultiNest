This package is a GNU build for MultiNest plugin to
ROOT by RooStats developers. See
https://github.com/svenkreiss/roostats/wiki/MultiNest-in-ROOT


Download MultiNest from:
   http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/multinest/

You might need to change the Makefile with the following suggestions:
   FC = $(shell root-config --f77) -fPIC
   FFLAGS += -O3 -ffree-line-length-none -I/usr/local/include
   CFLAGS += -O3


To compile, it is needed to set root v6 and multinest library directories
e.g.
--with-multinest-libdir=pathToYourMultiNestDirectoryWhereLibNest3Is

./configure --help 

and then ./configure; make; make install
